## Required External Files

To build this configuration, the following extra files are required. Putting them in this `store-files` directory will allow you to add them with `just store` and do garbage collection with `just clean`.
- `Wolfram_14.1.0_LIN_Bndl.sh`, the Wolfram (Mathematica) 14.1.0 installer script.
- `baserom.us.z64`, a US ROM of Super Mario 64 (for `sm64ex` and `sm64coopdx`)
