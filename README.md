A NixOS Configuration for my various machines.

### Hosts
- `metatron`: Main PC
- `jophiel`: Always-on desktop for hosting things (primarily discord bots)

If you want to use this configuration as a base, see `store-files/README.md` for what files you need already in the nix store for what packages.
