## Hardware Configs
This section breaks the Dendritic pattern as it uses the original `hardware-configuration.nix`es generated upon install. Or, in `nvidia/metatron`'s case, It works so I'm not touching it. These files should be manually imported in the corresponding **host** aspects. See `modules/hosts/metatron.nix` for an example.
